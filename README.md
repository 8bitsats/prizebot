# Motivation
There is no open source telegram bot that can purely raffle prizes, so I decided to do the one

The official bot is hosted at [@secure_prize_bot](https://t.me/secure_prize_bot)

# Running
    Dockerfile available for running, please check Dockerfile and prizebot.env

To run this bot by yourself provide the bot token with `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable.

You can always specify `LOG_CHAT_ID` if you want to send crashes to some chat.

### Database
By default, all data stored in `/data/` directory in json for startup convenience, but you can configure the database as following.

*Environment*:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DATABASE_USER`
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`
- `DATABASE_DRIVER` - driver class name (optional, by default 'Exposed' will try to extract it from url)

Do not forget to include the driver dependency via gradle, Postgres included by default

*Database Schema*:

> it will be created automatically, but if it will change during releases you have to update schema manually. Note that there are no plans for compatibility or DB migrations
